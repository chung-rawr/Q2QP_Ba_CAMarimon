        <h1>Philippine Eagle Center</h1>
        <p>The Philippine Eagle Center is home to 36 Philippine Eagles, 18 of which are captive-bred.</p>
        <p>It also houses 10 other species of birds, 4 species of mammals and 2 species of reptiles.</p>
        <p>Simulating a tropical rain forest environment, the Center offers the visitor a glimpse into the countryâ€™s forest ecosystem.</p>
        <p>Although the exhibits are used primarily to help educate the Filipino people on conservation, 
            the facility is also considered a major tourist attraction in Davao City.</p>
